    <h2>2 Feb 2017</h2>
    <p>We have drafted out 4 ideas for our project, listed below:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>FinicKEY (Videogame)  - 3D escape locked room/point-and-click game</li>
      <li>NoteHub (Web Service)- Note sharing service</li>
      <li>CodeAwesome - Mobile Version (Web App) - Brings programming to smartphones (specifically, the iPhone and Windows Phone, which have inadequate apps for such tasks due to Apple's supposed worries about phone safety...)</li>
      <li>Hwa Chong Utilities (Web App/App) - Combines attendance taking app, the intelligent Electronic Message Board (iEMB) and other helpful apps into one</li>
    </ol>
