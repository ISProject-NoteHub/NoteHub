    NoteHub is a note-sharing service meant for users of all ages.
    <br><br>You start off in the gallery, from which you can browse NoteHub according to the notes you have previously read through (in which case NoteHub suggests notes for you to read). 
    <br><br>You may also browse NoteHub manually.
    <br><br>You may create a new note and save it for everyone to see, but before NoteHub saves the note, NoteHub will use its own records of your credibility (built up by other users), the noteâ€™s citations and its keywords (diction would be applied) to determine how credible the note is and assign tags to it. 
    <br><br>NoteHub will then give suggestions to you which you may choose to resolve to increase their credibility. (Like Facebook face tagging / automated labelling.)
