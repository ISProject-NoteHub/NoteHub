				<br><h2>Problem</h2>
				In the modern world, the Internet stores a vast amount of information, which gives users access to many sources of information. However, these sources may not be reliable at times, and some reliable sources of information may be "lost" amidst the vastness of the Internet, resulting in a <b>fragmentation of information on the Internet</b>.
				<br><br>This makes it difficult at times for Internet users such as students to find notes on a particular subject, which lowers the efficiency and effectiveness of the Internet. Even though there are already some note-sharing services on the Internet, these services have weaknesses which reduce their effectiveness. These existing note-sharing services are thus inadequate for studying.

				<br><br><h2>Solution</h2>
				 Our solution to this is NoteHub, a free note-sharing service for anyone, even though it is targeted at students, which aims to <b>organise notes on the Internet into one place</b>, where they will be sorted according to their topic and credibility. This will be achieved through maintaining an algorithm-collated gallery, or "hub", of notes, as well as keeping a constantly updated list of notes from the Internet through users' contributions.
