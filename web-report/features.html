      <h1>Features</h1>
      <h2>Accounts System</h2>
      A sophisticated account system allows users to manage their accounts, allowing users to create, manage and delete their accounts. Passwords can be changed, along with settings and preferences for note topics that our algorithm picks up automatically, to serve the user with content that best suits them.

      <h2>Mobile-Readiness</h2>
      NoteHub is optimised for mobile devices as well as computers, so notes can really be accessed and collaborated on from anywhere. On smaller screens, the interface is able to properly resize and keep itself clean and simple for easy browsing.

      <h2>Note Editor</h2>
      Powered by CKEditor, our note editor operates with notebooks, much like how one would edit a OneNote notebook. However, public notes come with a special 'References' note, that is parsed by our algorithms. This ensures that public notes are of a substantial quality, as pubic notes can be browsed by almost anyone using NoteHub. 
      <br>The note editor enables text formatting, images and hyperlinks to be added to notes. These functions and more are neatly organised in a bar at the top of the page.

      <h2>Note Manager</h2>
      The note manager is a platform for users to edit their notes. It has a basic search function which allows users to find a specific note from their notes, as well as the ability to create, retrieve, update and delete notes. It also has a simple, easy-to-use interface.

      <h2>Gallery</h2>
      The Gallery is the Hub in NoteHub. It gathers all of the public notes on NoteHub and places it in one place where users can view them.
      <br>Currently, it has a fully-featured search which allows users to search for notes with ease. However, the gallery also includes suggestion algorithms which can put up recommended notes for users and give users suggestions on notes which they may be interested in. The gallery is supported by a clean, modern and full interface.

      <h2>Note-Sharing</h2>
      An essential feature of NoteHub, note sharing on NoteHub is easy. Notes can be shared via URLs or the Gallery. Play the video below to see a demonstration.

      <h2>Backend</h2>
      NoteHub's PHP backend can later be used to develop an API for NoteHub, paving the way for endless possibilities.
      <h2>Algorithms</h2>
      NoteHub's intelligent algorithms check for the credibility and content of a note. The algorithms can check for word count, suggest tags based on content and suggest notes for the user to read based on the user's previously read notes. The intelligent algorithms can also learn based on past experiences to check notes more accurately and precisely based on the content and credibility of the note.
